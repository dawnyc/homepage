I'm currently a **Machine Learning Engineer** at ByteDance, mainly on duty with research and development of Vision-Language Models for e-commerce safety. I received my **Master of Science in Engineering** in June 2024 at [MCG Group](https://mcg.nju.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/main.htm), under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Jie Tang](https://tangjie-njucs.github.io/). I also received my **Bachelor of Science** in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University in June 2021.

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Multimodal Deep Learning** and **Generative Deep Learning**, recently lie in **Visual Object Tracking (VOT)**, **Vision-Language Models** and **Generative Models**.

## News üî•
 * [ <u>2024.03.21</u> ] üìñ A [Zhihu Blog](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/662351482) is published to explain main ideas of the paper.
